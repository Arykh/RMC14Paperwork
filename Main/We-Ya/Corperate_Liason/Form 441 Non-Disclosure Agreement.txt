─────────────────────────────────────────
This [bold]Non-disclosure Agreement[/bold] is made effective as of March 30th 2187 by and between the undersigned [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] and [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] regarding the property and information related to all operational procedures.

[bold]I. Confidential Information:[/bold] The term 'Confidential Information' means any information which is proprietary to the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold], whether or not owned or developed by the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold], which is generally known other than by the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold], which the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] may obtain through any direct or indirect contact with the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold], regardless of whether specifically identified as confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information shall include any information provided by the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] concerning the business, technology, and information of the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] and any third party with which the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] deals, including, without limitation, business records and plans, trade secrets, technical data, product ideas, contracts, financial information, pricing structure, health discounts, computer programs, listings, and unknown wildlife, and all copyright and intellectual property. The nature of the information and the manner of disclosure are such that a reasonable person would understand it is confidential.

[bold]II. Protection of Confidential Information:[/bold] The [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] understands and acknowledges that the Confidential Information has been developed or obtained by the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] of The Company by investment of significant time, effort, and expense, and that the Confidential Information is valuable, special, and a unique asset of the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] which provides the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] with significant competitive advantage, and needs to be protected from improper disclosure. In consideration for the receipt by the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] of the Confidential Information, the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] agrees as follows:

[bold]III. Unauthorized Disclosure of Information - Injunction:[/bold] If it appears that the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] has disclosed (or has threatened to disclose) Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement, the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] shall be entitled to an injunction to restrain the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] from disclosing the Confidential Information in whole or in part. The [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] shall not be prohibited by this provision from pursuing other remedies, including a claim for losses and damages.

[bold]IV. Non-Circumvention:[/bold] For a period of five hundred (500) years after the end of the terms of this Agreement, the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] will not attempt to do business with or otherwise solicit any business contacts found or otherwise referred by [bold]|Corporation|[/bold]s to [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] for the purpose of circumventing, the result of which shall be to prevent the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] from realizing or recognizing a profit, fees, or otherwise, without the specific written approval of the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold]. If such circumvention shall occur, the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] shall be entitled to any commissions due pursuant to this agreement or relating to such transaction.

[bold]V. Return of Confidential Information:[/bold] Upon the written request of the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold], the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] shall return to the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] all written material containing the Confidential Information. The [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] shall also deliver to the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] written statements signed by the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] certifying that all materials have been returned within one (1) day of receipt of the request.

[bold]VII. Relationship of Parties:[/bold] Neither party has an obligation under this agreement to purchase products from the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold]. Under this clause, the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] is free to purchase weapons within the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold]'s inventory at the standard rate.

[bold]VIII. Term:[/bold] The obligations of this agreement shall survive until 03/30/2293 from the Effective date or until the [bold]|Corporation|[/bold] sends the [bold]Recipient|[/bold] written notice releasing the [bold]|Recipient|[/bold] from this Agreement.
