Marines, today we are deploying to [color=green](L-V624)(Solaris Ridge)(Shiva Snowball)(Fiorina Science Annex)(Trijent Dam)(New Varadero)(Kutjevo Refinery)[/color]. We have received a distress call from this location, followed by nothing else. You all know that means: it's time to go figure out what broke this time down there.

Get geared up, I want all SLs and Department Chiefs in the CIC for a moment. The press are welcomed to observe the meeting but must stay silent.

General Briefing will be announced after they are done in CIC.
